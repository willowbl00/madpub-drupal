This aims to create a form that can be posted on a Drupal site that will push data to a MADPub server.

======================================
The goal of this project is to build an application that streamlines the process of reporting and assessing the amount of damage in the occurrence of a natural disaster in the United States. Beta testing will be for the State of Washington.

In the event of a disaster, each county has a 72 hour window to report a dollar estimate of damage to the state and federal government in order meet the threshold for a federal declaration. The current system for assessing and reporting damage has many inefficiencies, requiring government personnel from each county to manually fill out a form after talking on the phone with the person reporting the damage. There are many variations of the same fields in different forms. During times of disaster it is challenging to collect this information with increased accuracy, reduction of duplicative work and an integrated way for the 3,143 counties in the United States to compile data
